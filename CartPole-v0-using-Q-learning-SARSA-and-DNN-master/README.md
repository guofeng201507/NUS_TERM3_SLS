#Solution to Cartpole balancing problem with the help of reinforcement learning and Deep Neural Networks.

I highly recommend going through following blogs and videos if you are new to RL

The code is well explaind by blog no 2 and 3 and it works very well using Q learning algorithm by stabilizing the pole for 200 timsteps but you can reach out to me on isaacpatole4u@gmail.com if you find yourself stuck at any point. 
I have also tried to solve the problem using Sarsa, it is also working fine but we only have to set the discount rate = 0.98. 

A Deep Neural Network can also come up with the solution to this problem, go through Sentdex's website (no. 4) for more info.
